SpamHamEDA
=============================
As a student I have compiled this notebook as a personal project for my EDA over the public SPAM message dataset.

Primary reason for compiling this notebook was to get hands-on experience in working with textual data, visualizations and KMeans clustering algorithm over the public SPAM dataset.
